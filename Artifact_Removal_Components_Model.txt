Eye blinking: check for related components, look at components maps, look at power spectrum of each component.

Eye movements: check for related components, look at components maps, look at power spectrum of each component.

Noisy channels: Individualise channels, Check for periodic noise inside channels, look at components maps -check that
		the activity comes from a single electrode-, look at power spectrum, try removing the
		component to see how it looks like.

Muscle artifacts: Check for components

Alpha waves: Check for components, look at components maps, look at power spectrum

Head and shoulder movements: these should be eliminated with the filters, but in any case check for related components, 
			     look at components maps, look at power spectrum.

Steps:

-Subject name: 

- Rename the dataset epochs

- Data sanity check with the spectral plot

* Eye blinking:   

* Eye movements:  

* Noisy channels: interpolate if needed.

* Alpha waves: 
	

# RUN SCRIPT: batch_analyze_Comp_Interp_AvRef_Notch.M  

		 
* Components to remove: 

* Remove external channels & Average reference.  (Does the av ref before the hand removing of muscular artifacts help?). 

* Notch Filter at 50Hz.

* Muscle artifacts: they shoulb be taken out in such a way that the remaining epochs do not give boundary problems when epoching

	- data rejected by hand:  


# RUN SCRIPT: batch_extractEpochsBash_BsAs.m

- Compare the amount of rejected epochs with Marco's script performance. Threshold of number of epochs for testing the difference?

- Extract Epochs for running ERPs.

- Extracy datasets for MVPA analysis.
